# 📱 Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

**End-to-End Machine Learning Project**

This project predicts whether a telecom customer is likely to churn using machine learning.
It includes data visualization, model training, and a Streamlit web app for real-time prediction.

## 🎯 Objective

Telecom companies lose revenue when customers leave ("churn").
This project helps **predict churn** early so companies can take action.

---

## 📊 Features

### ✔️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Customer demographics
* Contract & service usage
* Payment patterns
* Churn distribution
* Visualizations using Matplotlib & Seaborn

### ✔️ Machine Learning

* Model: **AdaBoost Classifier**
* Preprocessing: Label Encoding, Scaling
* Evaluation: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Precision & Recall

### ✔️ Deployment

* Interactive **Streamlit web app**
* User-friendly UI
* Real-time predictions using the trained `.pkl` model

---

## 🧠 Model

The final AdaBoost model is saved as:
**`ada_bundle.pkl`**

Loaded in `app.py` for prediction.
